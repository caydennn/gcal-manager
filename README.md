# Gcal Manager

Honestly just a dumb manager because I sometimes make careless mistakes on my gcal.

All this does right now is delete multiple non-recurring events that have certain keywords inside.
Just add in your keywords in the 'keywords' list in the script.

Might add more functionality as I make more dumb mistakes!
